        <h1>Harmonic Sequence Tutorial</h1>
        <p>A harmonic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the reciprocals of the terms form an arithmetic sequence. This means that if you take each term in the sequence and turn it into its reciprocal (1 divided by that term), the resulting numbers form a series with a constant difference.</p>
        
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>The simplest harmonic sequence is:</p>
        <p>1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ...</p>
        <p>In this sequence, if you take the reciprocal of each term, you get the arithmetic sequence:</p>
        <p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...</p>

        <h2>Properties of Harmonic Sequences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>n-th term</strong> of a harmonic sequence can be written as 1/n, where n is a positive integer.</li>
            <li>The sum of the terms in a harmonic sequence grows logarithmically, meaning it increases, but at a decreasing rate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Identify a Harmonic Sequence</h2>
        <p>If you have a sequence of numbers and want to check if it's harmonic, take the reciprocal of each term. If the new sequence forms an arithmetic sequence (one where the difference between consecutive terms is constant), then the original sequence is harmonic.</p>
